# House Price Prediction

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting house prices using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a model that accurately estimates the sale prices of houses based on various features.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle(#https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques). It includes [number_of_samples] samples and [number_of_features] features. The target variable is 'SalePrice,' representing the sale prices of houses.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory Data Analysis was conducted to gain insights into feature distributions, identify patterns, and visualize relationships between variables. Key visualizations, such as histograms and scatter plots, are available in the documentation.

## Feature Engineering

Feature engineering involved normalizing numerical features and handling missing values using the [imputation_strategy] strategy. Further details can be found in the [documentation](#documentation).

## Model Selection

We chose to use a Random Forest Regressor for its ability to handle non-linear relationships and capture feature importance.

## Usage

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ahmetmuratturk/PredictingHousePrices.git
cd PredictingHousePrices
